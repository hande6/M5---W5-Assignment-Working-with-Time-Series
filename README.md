# M5---W5-Assignment-Working-with-Time-Series

This project involves working with time-series data to predict weekly sales using a linear regression model. The dataset includes features such as store information, markdown data, and economic indicators.

Key Steps:
Data Loading: Importing datasets related to features, stores, and sales.
Data Merging: Combining these datasets on common columns.
Data Preprocessing:
Converting date columns to datetime format.
Handling missing values in markdown columns.
Feature Selection: Choosing relevant features for the regression model.
Model Training:
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a linear regression model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:
Making predictions on the test set.
Calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate model performance.
Visualization: Plotting actual vs. predicted sales values to visualize model performance.
Libraries Used:
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Numpy
How to Use:
Ensure all required libraries are installed.
Run the script to load and preprocess the data.
Train the model and evaluate its performance.
Visualize the results.
This project demonstrates the process of preparing time-series data, training a regression model, and evaluating its performance. It is a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world data.
